# 🏥🔐 Medical Device Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment  
### Secure-by-Design Analysis for a Cloud-Connected Healthcare System

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project presents a **portfolio-grade Product Security case study** focused on **threat modeling, risk assessment, and mitigation design** for a **cloud-connected medical device ecosystem** operating in a regulated healthcare environment.

Using a publicly available **medical device reference architecture** as a baseline, this project applies **secure design principles** to identify, analyze, and mitigate security risks that could directly impact **patient safety, data integrity, and regulatory compliance**.

The objective is to demonstrate **how a Product Security Engineer approaches security early in the design lifecycle**—before vulnerabilities become incidents—by combining **architecture analysis, threat modeling (STRIDE), risk scoring, and defense-in-depth controls**.

> 🛑 This is **not** a functional medical device implementation.  
> 🛡️ This is a **security-focused design and risk analysis**, aligned with real-world product security practices.

## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates

This case study showcases hands-on capability in:

- **Product Security & Secure Architecture Review**
- **Threat Modeling (STRIDE)**
- **Risk Assessment (DREAD / CVSS-style prioritization)**
- **Attack Surface Analysis**
- **Security Control Design & Defense-in-Depth**
- **Cloud, API, and Device Security**
- **Healthcare & Safety-Critical Risk Thinking**
- **Security-by-Design & Shift-Left Practices**

The analysis goes beyond tool usage and focuses on **decision-making, trade-offs, and risk-based prioritization**, which are core expectations for **senior Product Security and AppSec roles**.

## 🧠 Why This Matters (Product Security Context)

Medical devices are **cyber-physical systems**—security failures do not just lead to data breaches, but can directly affect:

- 🧑‍⚕️ **Patient safety**
- 🏥 **Clinical decision accuracy**
- 📊 **Data integrity of medical records**
- ⚖️ **Regulatory and compliance posture**
- 🛑 **Operational continuity of healthcare services**

This project treats security risks as **product risks**, not just technical issues, aligning with how **modern Product Security teams operate**.

---

## 🏗️ Scope of Security Analysis

The threat model and risk assessment cover:

- Embedded medical device identity and trust
- Cloud backend and microservices
- APIs and data exchange
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Device-to-cloud communication
- Clinician and administrative access
- Logging, auditability, and incident traceability

Trust boundaries, attack vectors, and failure modes are explicitly identified and evaluated from an **adversarial perspective**.

### 🔎 Final Note

> **Good product security is invisible to users—but obvious to attackers.**  
> This project demonstrates how to identify and reduce risk *before* attackers do.
